 * NOTES: TODO review these
 *
 * 1. The device ID is a hard coded constant in the blink to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW IC unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the
 *    DW IC during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone elseï¿½s implementation. We recommended that
 *    customers buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW IC User Manual.
 * 2. The chosen method for waking the DW IC up here is by maintaining SPI chip select line low for at least 500 us. This means that we need a buffer
 *    to collect the data that DW IC outputs during this dummy SPI transaction. The length of the transaction, and then the time for which the SPI
 *    chip select is held low, is determined by the buffer length given to dwt_spicswakeup() so this length must be chosen high enough so that the
 *    DW IC has enough time to wake up.
 * 3. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 4. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 5. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *    configuration.
