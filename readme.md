Makerfabs ESP32 UWB contains an ESP32 and a DW3000 chip.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a short-range, wireless communication protocol that operates through radio waves, enables secure reliable ranging and precision sensing, creating a new dimension of spatial context for wireless devices.

Makerfabs ESP32 UWB module, which is based on IC DecaWave DW1000, has been greatly popular and liked by many Makers. And many customers ask us for the newest DW3000 version, after long-term comparison & testing, now it's available!~

Compares to the DWM1000, the DWM3000 has advantages as below:
1. Most important: Interoperable with Apple U1 chip, that makes it possible to work with the Apple system;
2. Fully aligned with FiRa™ PHY, MAC, and certification development, which make it more suitable for further applications;
3. Much lower Power consumption, almost 1/3 of DWM1000;
4. Supports UWB channels 5 (6.5 GHz) and 9 (8 GHz), while DWM1000 does not support Channel 9;



## Feature

- Integrated ESP32 2.4G WiFi and Bluetooth.
- DW3000 UWB module.
